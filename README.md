# pathfinding-visualizer

Pathfinding visualizer is a small java project created by Cyruss Allen Amante that allows the visualization of certain
Graph pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra, Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.

The user may draw walls on the grid to create obstacles for the pathfinding visualizer. It is an easy way to learn how
these algorithms work and apply them towards their own knowledge.

More complex and efficient algorithms such as A* are planned to be implemented. 

This was inspired by  Clement Mihailescu's online pathfinding visualizer which can be found here: https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#
